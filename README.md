Python Challenge: PyBank and PyPoll

Overview

In this project, I tackled two distinct challenges using Python: PyBank and PyPoll. Each challenge involved analyzing real-world data to uncover valuable insights and present the results in a clear, actionable format. This project not only tested my coding skills but also my ability to interpret and communicate data effectively.

Technical Skills Utilized

Languages

Python: Leveraged for scripting and data manipulation, utilizing libraries like csv for reading data files and handling complex data operations.

Database and Data Analysis

CSV Files: Managed and analyzed large datasets from CSV files to perform financial and election data analysis.
Data Processing: Implemented techniques to handle data transformations, calculations, and aggregations.

Tools

Visual Studio Code: Used for writing and debugging Python scripts. Utilized version control integration to manage code changes.
Git and GitHub: Employed for version control, including committing code changes, pushing to repositories, and managing branches. Enabled collaboration and code review processes.

Data Skills

Data Analysis: Conducted in-depth analyses to calculate financial metrics and election results. Created scripts to compute total amounts, averages, and identify key trends.
Data Visualization: Presented findings clearly using textual summaries. (For future projects, this could include charts and graphs.)

Soft Skills

Problem Solving: Addressed challenges related to data accuracy and script functionality. Developed solutions to ensure correct results and efficient data handling.
Attention to Detail: Ensured accuracy in data processing and results, making sure all calculations and outputs were correct.
Purpose of the Project

PyBank

The PyBank challenge involved analyzing a company's financial records to extract key financial metrics. The purpose was to:

Calculate Total Months: Determine the total number of months covered by the dataset.
Net Total Amount: Compute the overall profit or loss over the period.
Analyze Changes: Identify month-to-month changes in profits and calculate the average change.
Find Extremes: Discover the greatest increase and decrease in profits, including the respective dates.
Objective: The goal was to demonstrate proficiency in financial data analysis, handling large datasets, and generating insightful financial reports.

PyPoll

The PyPoll challenge focused on analyzing election data to provide a comprehensive overview of the voting results. The purpose was to:

Total Votes: Calculate the total number of votes cast.

Candidate Analysis: List candidates, their vote percentages, and total votes received.
Determine the Winner: Identify the candidate with the highest number of votes.
Objective: The aim was to showcase skills in election data analysis, including vote counting, percentage calculations, and result presentation.
